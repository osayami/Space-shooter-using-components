I followed this [tutorial series by heartbeast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9FzW-m48fn09w6j8NowI_pSBVcsb3V78)

## Techniques use:
- Class based components (Composition over inheritance)
- A simple resource to store movement stats (like speed)
- Audio buses to separate game music and other sounds which could utilized in the future to implement a settings menu
- Node based state machine for the pink enemies
